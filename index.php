             <div class="col-md-8 right-two text-justify"><p>I am a professional, proficient, and polite individual. For four years, I was a part of the United State Navy. This honorable experience allowed me to serve my country. In addition, I was able to obtain valuable skills and training. While working as a team member in the U.S. Navy, I was promoted to a leadership position. After being in the military, I have successful spoke at speaking engagements and received my Realtor License. Through a series of coding creative projects, I discovered a passion for coding. The ability to create something out of nothing is a skill I truly value. Currently, I am enrolled at Great Bay Community College. My major is Computer Science. I have a strong support system - my lovely wife, Brenda, and my adorable dog Lassie.</p></div>
